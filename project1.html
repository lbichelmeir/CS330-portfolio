        <p>This Fall, I took a class called CS 396: Generative Methods. 
            One of my projects was doing a data visualization using HTML, CSS and JavaScript P5 (Processing). 
            I visualized the Top Hits of 2021 using Spotify's song metrics, such as danceability and valence (the cheeriness of a song). 
            I found the data from a Kaggle dataset that used Spotify's API to get the Top Hits data.</p>

        <p>(the visualization only works on Chrome)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li>
            <li>Valence: Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</li>
            <li>Energy: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.</li>
            <li>Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration.</li>
            <li>Loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.</li>
            <li>Speechiness: This detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.</li>
            <li>Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.</li>
            <li>Key: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.</li>
